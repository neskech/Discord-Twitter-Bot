# Twitter Bot

A discord bot designed to be hosted on replit. Utilizes the tweepy api to allow users to create simple tweets for a specific account

*Note, this project uses V 1.1 of the twitter api via tweepy. In order to use this, you'll need to apply for 'elevated' access on twitter's developer portal. V 1.1 is required to tweet images, which is why I'm using it* 

- Commands (prefaced by !)
  -
      - tweet: (Message) 
      - tweetImg: (Image url, Message) 
      - reply: (Tweet url, Message) 
      - replyImg: (Tweet url, Image url, Message) 
      - quote: (Tweet url, Message) 
      - quoteImg: (Tweet url, Image url, Message)
